# ChemHermes

## Overview
ChemHermes is a specialized GPT designed for cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and material science research. It integrates with APIs and tools to perform chemical structure searches, molecular descriptor calculations, and real-time 3D molecular visualization using 3Dmol.js.

## Features
- 3D Molecular Structure Visualization
- Molecular Descriptor Calculation
- Chemical Structure Similarity Search
- Predicting ADMET Properties
- Quantum Chemistry Simulations (Psi4 integration)

## How to Use
1. **3D Molecular Visualization**: 
   - Navigate to the `actions/render3DMolecule` folder.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser.
   - Pass molecular data in SDF or PDB format to visualize the structure.
   
2. **Molecular Descriptor Calculation**:
   - Coming soon: RDKit-based descriptor calculations for properties like logP, molecular weight, etc.
